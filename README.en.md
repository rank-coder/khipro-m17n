This is the m17n version of Khipro. If used with Typing-booster, you’ll get even better predictions and suggestions.  
* **Linux:** khipro-m17n can be used directly. It works with either ibus or fcitx. Detailed usage instructions for Linux are available in this documentation.  
* **Windows:** Khipro can be used through the new variant of Borno Keyboard – **Borno (Native)**. You can get early access from the [Borno support group (Telegram)](https://t.me/codepotro).  
* **Android:** Very soon, Khipro will also be available on Android via the Borno Android app. Keep an eye on the Borno support group.

# Documentation

## Introduction
When typing in Avro Keyboard’s phonetic layout, we often have to press **Shift** repeatedly, which disrupts typing flow and continuity. As a result, typing speed cannot increase much beyond a certain limit. In China, a romanization system called *Pinyin* uses case-insensitive phonetic mapping. That’s why we’re trying to bring similar speed improvements to Bangla romanization-based typing. With Pinyin-based input methods, the Chinese can type their complex language even faster than English.  

Development of the Khipro keyboard is still ongoing. If you have complaints or suggestions, please contact us using the [link](#contact) below.

<br> You’ll get double the benefit if you use Khipro Keyboard with Typing-booster. However, you may also use it without Typing-booster. As shown in the picture above, suggestions will appear; by using keyboard shortcuts, you can instantly commit the suggestion corresponding to its number.
