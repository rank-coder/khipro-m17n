This is the **m17n version** of Khipro. When used with Typing-booster, it provides better prediction and suggestions.  

* **On Linux:** khipro-m17n can be used directly. It works through ibus or fcitx. Detailed instructions for Linux use are included in this documentation.  
* **On Windows:** Khipro can be used via a new variant of Borno Keyboard—**Borno (Native)**. You can get early access to it in [Borno’s support group (Telegram)](https://t.me/codepotro).  
* **On Android:** Khipro will soon be available via the Borno Android app. Keep an eye on the Borno support group for updates.

# Documentation  

## Introduction  
For Bangla phonetic typing, **Avro** is popular. But frequent use of **Shift** and some distant keys (like `^` for ঁ) slow down speed and flow. After a point, it becomes impossible to increase typing speed further.  

To overcome this limitation, we took inspiration from **China’s Pinyin system**. Since Pinyin is case-insensitive and offers intelligent suggestions, Chinese users can type Chinese faster than English.  

Khipro brings that same idea—Bangla typing without using **Shift**, making it faster and smoother. All necessary symbols can be typed without moving your hands away.  

On Linux, with Typing-booster, Khipro becomes even faster, as it provides predictions for multiple upcoming words. On Windows, Android, and other platforms, predictive text will also be available through apps implementing Khipro.
